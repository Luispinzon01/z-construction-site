/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Every word, number and link on the site lives here, once per language.
   Editing the site's words almost never means touching a component.

   The Spanish is written as its own copy, not run through the English. It
   speaks to the Hispanic families and landlords of Auburn, Opelika and Lee
   County in the "usted" register they'd expect from a contractor they are
   about to trust with their house: direct, warm, no marketing gloss.

   Rule for this file: only claims the business can back up. No invented
   project counts, no sample reviews shown as real, no backstory the owner
   hasn't confirmed. Real reviews go in `reviews.items` (verbatim, with
   permission) and the site switches from the rating block to review cards.

   CONFIRM BEFORE LAUNCH (search "TODO"): phone, WhatsApp, email, license
   number, Angi / HomeAdvisor / Google links, price ranges, the one-day reply
   promise, real photos.
